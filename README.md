# SpaceX-Website-Clone
This is a Responsive spacex website clone built usinhg html, css and javascript.
I have built a landing page and three more inner pages.
Firstly there is a top navbar which is static which contains links to inner pages and some more pages.
On the side there is a menu button which on clicking displays various options to go on.
Next there are sections of satellite projects on which spacex is working currently.
Then at last there is a footer section.
